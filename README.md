Run DiabloPad.exe as Administrator to allow full control and permissions.

Connect & Power On Your Controller before launching DiabloPad so it’s detected correctly.

Open DiabloPad and follow these setup steps:

Select Game Window: In the Window Selection tab, choose the game window you want to control. (This ensures center position calibration is relative to your game window.)
Calibrate Sticks: Go to the Calibration tab, click Calibrate Sticks, and keep analog sticks in neutral to fix drift issues (if needed, repeat for optimal results).
Set Center Position: In the Calibration tab, click Set Center Position and set it by clicking dead center on your in-game character. (This enables the left analog stick for movement.)
Configure Controller Mappings: In Controller Mappings, assign custom actions or macros to controller buttons.
Create Macros: In Macros, create custom multi-step actions. For example, set F8 to town portal in-game, then add a macro with:
0 ms: Press F8
50 ms: Right Click
Assign this to a button to use it with a single press.
Adjust Settings: In Settings, tweak mouse speed for the right analog stick, and use Movement Radius to set the left stick’s range relative to your screen resolution.
